## Image recognition with machine learning.
This project aims to develop a self-driving car using code from python libraries (opencv, tensorflow, keras)
and to merge them with hardware solutions. 

![progress of the self-driving-pi platform](https://github.com/twochemist/img_recog_py/blob/master/sketch.png?raw=true "prototype")

The hardware construction includes:


1x Raspberry pi 3B+

4x Rubber wheels

2x 5v DC motors

1x motor controller

1x 12V power bank

1x Main frame 

1x L298N H-Bridge motor controller

 x cables and miscellaneous
